a little app i used chatgpt to make, i recommend using this with OnTopReplica https://github.com/LorenzCK/OnTopReplica/releases
use 1, 2, 3, and 4 to add tally marks for whatever reason you need, press 0 to reset all marks and use "-" to undo last mark
you can also take the code and customize it if you wish
